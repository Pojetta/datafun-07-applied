# Project 7 is a guided project on machine learning. 

We'll employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model and use the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line, i.e. a linear equation) to make predictions.

## How to Install and Run the Project 
```
1. Create a new repo in GitHub and included a README

2. Clone it to machine with: git clone <your repo URL>

3. In VS Code, create a .gitignore file and added: .vscode/ and .venv/

4. In VS Code, add venv: python3 -m venv .venv

5. Activate venv with: source .venv/bin/activate

6. Add a requirements text (requirements.txt) with a list of the packages required for this project. 

7. Install the packages listed in requirements text with: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  
or use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate a requirements text.

8. Use git add., git commit, and git push to sync local changes to remote repo in GitHUb.

```  

## How to set up Jupyter using VS Code
```
1. Install the Jupyter Extension: If not already installed, add the Jupyter extension to VS Code. 

2. Open your root project repository folder in VS Code.

3. From the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), select "Python: Select Interpreter" and choose the interpreter from your virtual environment.

```
  

## How to Create and Start a New Jupyter Notebook

```
1. In the VS Code Explorer, create a new file. Ensure it has a .ipynb extension.

2. Add a Markdown cell at the top of your notebook with the introduction (include the title, author, date, the purpose of the project, and the url to your project repository.).

3. Import Dependencies in a Python cell (At the Top, After the Introduction)

4. Execute the cell to ensure everything works. 

```
### Additional Setup
After installing the required packages, run the following command to enable Jupyter Notebook extensions:

`jupyter contrib nbextension install --user`
